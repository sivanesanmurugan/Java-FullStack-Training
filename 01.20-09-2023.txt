Types of data transfer methods,
    1.UDP
    2.TCP
    3.IP
    4.DNS(domain name system)it is used for finding the ip address 
    5.HTTPS
UDP have very fast data transfer they don't store any log data for eg UDP is using in video call and voice call during UDP data loss will be happen it don't care abouts this. But TCP method stores the log and it helps to rectify the error later period.
And how DNS works and website ip. Each website have unique IP and that ip is mapped to the domain name called google.com have unique ip.
